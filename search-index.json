[{"content":"<p>The purpose of this publication is to learn the digital publication tool, Quire, and consolidate research conducted over the course of my Getty Marrow Undergrad Internship during the Summer of 2024 about the revolutionary artist Ulises Carrión and his publication, <em>Arguments</em>.

Reed and Phillips’ publication was a wonderful photographic catalog of a portion of the Getty Research Institute’s library of artist books. Out of all the beautiful and thought-provoking artist books, I was drawn to the images of <em>Arguments</em> by Ulises Carrión. Initially it caught my eye because of the vibrant color scheme of red, magenta, orange, brown, and purple. The color scheme felt familiar and even familial; reminding me of the color schemes of my family’s home. As I look a deeper look, I found an artist whose story and cultural background resonated with me and whose work opened a new exciting avenue for me to view books as a medium for art.</p>\n","length":208,"title":"Cover","type":"cover","url":"https://lalamillo.github.io/bookworks/"},{"content":"<figure id=\"fig-78\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-78\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/desk.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/desk.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<p>Layla Alamillo (She/They) is a recent graduate from Cal Poly Pomona earning a BFA in Visual Communications Design and a double minor in Art History and Ceramics.

Though Carrión held may titles, for the purpose of this research, we will focus on three: playwright, conceptual writer, and maker of bookworks.</p>\n<p>Carrión studied literature and philosophy at UNAM (The National University of Mexico). Early in his career, he grew acclaim in the Mexican literary scene with his two plays: <em>La Muerte de Miss O</em>, 1966, and <em>De Alemania</em>, 1970. There was a stark pivot in Carrión’s thinking after the creation of these two plays when he moved to Amsterdam in 1972. He began to break into thinking conceptually about the potential of language, structure, and the book as a medium. In 1973, <em>Arguments</em>, the subject of this study, was published by Beau Geste Press. In 1975, Carrión’s essay, “The New Art of Making Books” was published in <em>Kontexts</em> no. 6/7, edited by Michael Gibbs.</p>\n<p>While the conceptual essay, “The New Art of Making Books,” was published two years after <em>Arguments</em>, the principles put forth in his essay had long been a topic of discussion for Carrión<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn5\" id=\"fnref5\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">5</a></sup>. “The New Art of Making Books,” puts forth a new etiquette to treat the medium of books that allows for the artist<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn6\" id=\"fnref6\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">6</a></sup> to evaluate the potential of this medium. The essay is broken up in to six parts; What a Book is, Prose and Poetry, The Space, The Language, Structures, and The Reading.

A structural motif throughout this essay is the parallel conversation outlining what the “old art” of making books is and asserting a new approach to the medium. Drawing on the general perceptions of books, Carrión identifies that in a traditional book there is a distinction between the author of the text and the creator of the physical book. In the new art, the author and creator are one.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A book may be the accidental container of a text…&quot;<br>\n<em>Ulises Carrión</em></p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>What may sound like a cynical statement about books holds a deep truth about the evolution of the book form. In Amaranth Borsuk’s, “The Book,” she writes that a book is a “portable data storage and distribution method.” From the clay tablets of Sumer to the new releases of Getty Publications, books have been used to hold information and tell a story. A very abbreviated description for the evolution to the codex<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> proceeds as follows:</p>\n<div class=\"centered-text\">\n<p><strong>Clay Tablet</strong></p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p><strong>More Malleable Materials (Papyrus)</strong></p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p><strong>Scroll</strong></p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p><strong>Accordian Fold</strong></p>\n<p>|</p>\n<p><strong>Codex</strong></p>\n</div>\n<p>The shift from oral to written language was an important milestone in human history and gave rise to various physical mediums for record keeping. It all began with the clay tablet that arose in Sumer between 8500 and 3000 BCE as the earliest example of this shift.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> In other parts of the world, more malleable materials like papyrus evolved. With the advent of more malleable materials, the scroll form developed for ease of transportation. While the scroll was much easier to transport than a trailing leaf of papyrus, it was difficult to unfurl and read. The accordion fold developed for ease of reading allowing for segmented portions of the text to be read at a time. Through binding the accordion form, the codex as we know it today evolved.<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn3\" id=\"fnref3\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">3</a></sup> As bookworks,<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn4\" id=\"fnref4\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">4</a></sup> also referred to as artists books, come into the picture, they play with the concept of what constitutes a book and how to push the boundaries of a medium that has evolved over time.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>A book is a space-time sequence.”<br>\nUlises Carrión</p>\n</blockquote>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>A codex is a book form characterized as a block of pages bound on one side in between covers.

Books with the intention of storing text generally follow a similar layout and set of rules including margins along each side with a block of text populating the center. This structure developed over time because of the laws of language and the use of the book as a storage device. Carrión identifies this and puts forth the concept of a new art of books that uses each element of a book to enhance the narrative rather than solely containing it.</p>\n<p>We begin to see Carrión creating a distinction between prose<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn1\" id=\"fnref1\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">1</a></sup> and poetry<sup class=\"footnote-ref\"><a href=\"#fn2\" id=\"fnref2\" class=\"footnote-ref-anchor\">2</a></sup> through the inclusion of space and the book medium. Through his distinction, we must consider the nature of storytelling. To speak a story is to convey emotion through tone, pauses, and emphasis, but to translate that same story to a written and physical medium, like paper, challenges us to find other ways to convey that emotion without those audible queues. In Carrión’s definition of prose, that element of emotion was often added back in through description. In Carrión’s definition of poetry, the element of emotion is done through space on the page.</p>\n<p>In <em>Arguments</em>, rather than writing prose detailing the contexts of these arguments, Carrión only includes the names of the participates and the space on the page to tell the story (<a href=\"#fig-1\">fig.1</a>). The spacing and treatment of the names as characters are the only indication of how the argument plays out. Given Carrión’s background as a playwright, it is almost as if the names of the participants of the argument are used as place markers and the page is the stage.</p>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-79\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-79\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/proseandpoetry_2.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/proseandpoetry_2.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure><figure id=\"fig-80\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-80\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/proseandpoetry_3.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/proseandpoetry_3.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure></div> </figure>\n<section class=\"footnotes\">\n<ol class=\"footnotes-list\">\n<li id=\"fn1\" class=\"footnote-item\"><p>A literary medium closest to the patterns of everyday speech.

To highlight the various methods of reading Carrión creates, we will look at Argument 20 and Argument 5.</p>\n<h2>Argument 20</h2>\n<figure id=\"fig-2\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-2\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-2.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-2.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Page numbers: 73-74</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Images: 53-54</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper color: Purple</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>The standard method of reading proceeds from left to right, top to bottom. With each subsequent argument, Carrión challenges the reader to decipher the new method of reading he has created. In Argument 20, between Nicholas and Emma, he has created a system of reading the two columns of names simultaneously. Because the argument is comprised of the same word; Nicholas and Emma, the reader can anticipate the pattern and scan the page from top down, stopping to notice the disruption in the pattern in the lower left corner when the pattern breaks and Nicholas’ name becomes jumbled and loses letters. Rather than reading left to right, top to bottom, “reading” in this instance is akin to a form of pattern recognition through space navigated from the top of the page to the bottom.</p>\n<h2>Argument 5</h2>\n<figure id=\"fig-4\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-4\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-4.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-4.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure>\n<figure class=\"q-figure q-figure--group\"> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-5\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-5\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-5.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-5.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure><figure id=\"fig-6\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-6\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-6.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-6.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure></div> <div class=\"q-figure--group__row columns\"><figure id=\"fig-7\" class=\"q-figure q-figure--image column q-figure--group__item quire-grid--2\"> <a class=\"q-figure__modal-link\" href=\"#fig-7\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"><img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-7.jpg\"> </a> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"html\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> <img alt=\"\" class=\"q-figure__image\" src=\"/_assets/images/figures/fig-7.jpg\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <figcaption class=\"q-figure__caption\" data-outputs-include=\"epub,pdf\"> <span class=\"q-figure__caption-content\"></span> <span class=\"q-figure__credit\"></span> </figcaption> </figure></div> </figure>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Page numbers: 27-32</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Images: 15-18</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Paper color: Brown</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>While Argument 20 creates a reading system of spatial pattern recognition, Argument 5 is sequential. Through the inclusion of “a)” “b)” etc. Carrión indicates to the reader that there is a set order to read these arguments. Each subsection is comprised of a column of names ending with the word “etc.” Intuitively, each one of these sections is read from top to bottom then moving onto the next section. This reading system is enforced by section “n” which reads “et cetera” letter by letter from top to bottom. This section functions as a key for the reading system Carrión created for argument 5. Through taking the word “etc,” which had previously been written at the end of each section horizontally and manipulating it to not only cap the end of the argument as a whole, but to indicate the reading system created visually enforces the top to bottom left to right reading order.</p>\n","length":587,"title":"The Reading","type":"essay","url":"https://lalamillo.github.io/bookworks/01_Arguments/03.5_The_Reading_Carrion/"},{"content":"","length":0,"title":"Lines/Líneas of Further Research","type":"table-of-contents","url":"https://lalamillo.github.io/bookworks/02_Lines_of_Further_Research/"},{"content":"<p><strong>Looking for poetry</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Tras La poesia</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Ulises Carrión</strong></p>\n<p>Relation to <strong>Arguments</strong>:<br>\nAnother (possibly the only other) bookwork Ulises Carrión created with Beau Geste Press</p>\n<p>Dimensions</p>\n<p>With: 10cm</p>\n<p>Height: 15.5 cm</p>\n<p>Depth of spine: 9/10 cm</p>\n<p>General notes</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Time-space sequence</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Consistent series of 8 horizontal lines with various text</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Text such as “wires” or “cables” allows the viewer to imagine these 8 purple lines as new items on each subsequent page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>5 chapters each with a different unspoken theme that challenge the reader to imagine the lines in different contexts</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Colors of the publication are orange purple, red with an off-white paper —&gt; color trend of Carrións work</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>With the flipping of each page, the reader seems to be following a line (linea) of thought</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Chapter one moves from words like string, cables,</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>threads/hilos</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>wires/alambres</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>strings/cuerdas</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>cables/cables</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>hairs/cabellos</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>arteries/arterias (accent on the i)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>canals/canales</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>rivers/rios (accent on I)</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>roads/caminos</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Images</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>1-3: Cover, spine, back cover</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>4: first spread, showing lines by themselves</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>5: title page</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>6: Chapter 1 spread, all chapter spreads are the same style with overlapping sketchy red numbers on the purple lines, transparency, beautiful</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>7: first spread of every chapter</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n","length":161,"title":"*Looking for Poety/Tras la Poesía*","type":"essay","url":"https://lalamillo.github.io/bookworks/02_Lines_of_Further_Research/Looking_for_Poetry_Tras_La%20Poesia/"},{"content":"<p>Felipe Ehrenberg</p>\n<p>Cullompton, UK: Beau Geste Press</p>\n<p>Materials</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>“Waste Wrapping Paper”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Bound in Used Corrugated Cardboard</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Printing Method</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Offset Printing</p>\n<ul>\n<li>“Old Offset Machine called Ophelia”</li>\n</ul>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Binding Method</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Perfect Bound with a Softcover</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Dimensions</p>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<p>Width: 6”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Height: 8 3/4”</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p>Spine Depth: 3/16”</p>\n</li>\n</ul>\n<p>“Tell me what you collect + I’ll tell you who you are…”</p>\n<p>“…it dawned on me that a very direct way to understand a person’s mind, unencumbered by preconceptions, is to interpret the many things a person picks up, attracts, craves, gathers during a lifetime (or parts of it)…”</p>\n<p>“exercise in perception”</p>\n<p>“They are what in turn make me tick – anti-clockwise.”</p>\n<p>“ISBN, for whatever it is worth…”</p>\n","length":91,"title":"*Pussywillow: A Journal of Conditions, 1973 (Autumn 1973)*","type":"essay","url":"https://lalamillo.github.io/bookworks/02_Lines_of_Further_Research/Pussywillow_Felipe_Ehrenberg/"},{"content":"<p><strong>Beau Geste Press</strong></p>\n<p>Relation to this publication</p>\n<p>Published by Beau Geste Press.
