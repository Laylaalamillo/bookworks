General notes

-   Opens upwards like a legal pad

-   Text on both sides of the paper so as you open you read it like one big linear column (like a scroll)

-   Plays with how the viewer reads the text, not in the way carrion does with using new methods of reading other than left right top bottom, but in a way that the text is positioned vertically on some spaces and horizontally on other so the reader has to flip the book as you read it

-   Diff color paper

-   Interspersed with different size paper and diff material likely to indicate a break or a chapter of sorts

-   Pictures of orgies pasted in

Images
