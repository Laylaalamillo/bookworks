General notes

-   Time-space sequence

-   Consistent series of 8 horizontal lines with various text

-   Text such as “wires” or “cables” allows the viewer to imagine these 8 purple lines as new items on each subsequent page

-   5 chapters each with a different unspoken theme that challenge the reader to imagine the lines in different contexts

-   Colors of the publication are orange purple, red with an off-white paper —\> color trend of Carrións work

-   With the flipping of each page, the reader seems to be following a line (linea) of thought

-   threads/hilos

-   wires/alambres

-   strings/cuerdas

-   cables/cables

-   hairs/cabellos
