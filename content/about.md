About this project 
The purpose of this publication is to consolidate the research conducted over the course of my Getty Marrow Undergrad Internship during the Summer of 2024 about the prolific artist Ulises Carrión and his publication, *Arguments*. It creates a central place to hold notes, images, and analyses to be read and referred to while physically viewing *Arguments* by Ulises Carrión.
