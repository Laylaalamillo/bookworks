The purpose of this publication is to learn the digital publication tool, Quire, and consolidate research conducted over the course of my Getty Marrow Undergrad Internship during the Summer of 2024 about the revolutionary artist Ulises Carrión and his publication, *Arguments*. It creates a central place to hold notes, images, and analyses to be read and referred to while physically viewing *Arguments* by Ulises Carrión.

My research for this publication began by diligently annotating *Artists and Their Books, Books and their Artists*, by Marcia Reed and Glenn Phillips with a storm of neon yellow sticky notes. Reed and Phillips’ publication was a wonderful photographic catalog of a portion of the Getty Research Institute’s library of artist books. Out of all the beautiful and thought-provoking artist books, I was drawn to the images of *Arguments* by Ulises Carrión. Initially it caught my eye because of the vibrant color scheme of red, magenta, orange, brown, and purple. The color scheme felt familiar and even familial; reminding me of the color schemes of my family’s home. As I look a deeper look, I found an artist whose story and cultural background resonated with me and whose work opened a new exciting avenue for me to view books.
