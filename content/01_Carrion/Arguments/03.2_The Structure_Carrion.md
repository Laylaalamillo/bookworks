> “In a book of the old art words transmit the author's intention. That's why he chooses them carefully. In a book of the new art words don't transmit any intention; they're used to form a text which is an element of a book, and it is this book, as a totality, that transmits the author's intention.”

-   Ulises Carrión

The distinction between the “old” and “new” art is that books of the “old art” are dependent on the text within to give the book meaning, while in the new art the book is a liberated entity where text can be used as one of the tools to enhance the bookwork. The elements of the books structure used to tell the story in Carrión’s *Arguments* includes the physical space of the book, color distinctions, design motifs, text, and a new system of reading.
