### "Space" will be evaluated in two sections: the space of a book as a whole and the space of a single page.

##  The Space of the Book

> “The old art assumes that printed words are printed on an ideal space.[^1]\
> The new art knows that books exist as objects in an exterior reality, subject to concrete conditions of perception, existence, exchange, consumption, use, etc.”

-   Ulises Carrión

While conducting research and viewing images of *Arguments* does not compare to the experience of physically leafing through each page and being able to feel the grain and weight of the paper, note the dimensions and material make-up of the book.

***Arguments**, 1973*
Ulises Carrión (Mexican, 1941-1989)
Cullompton, UK: Beau Geste Press
>
**Dimensions**

-   Width: 6”

-   Height: 8 3/4”

-   Depth (spine): 5/16”

**Materials**

-   Cover: Red

-   Various colored paper including: brown, orange, magenta, purple and white

-   200 copies printed on Strathmore Grandee paper

-   200 copies printed on Huntsman white cartridge

**Printing Method**

-   Likely mimeograph or offset

**Binding Method**

-   Perfect Bound with a Softcover

With a width of six inches and a height of eight- and three-quarter inches *Arguments* is about the size of a piece of copy paper folded in half horizontally with the depth of the spine sitting at five sixteenths of an inch. The book is neither excessively big or intimately small, allowing the reader a level of distance and observation for the arguments presented at hand.

Space is also characterized by light and therefore color as a reflection of light will be considered in this analysis as an element of space. The cover is a rich and vibrant red which conveys a feeling of heat and anger. The enclosed text block consists of various colored paper including brown, orange, magenta, purple and white. Overall, a very warm-toned piece of work which adds to the concept and temperature of an argument.

##  The Space of the Page

{% figure 'fig-2' %}

Each page is six by eight- and three-quarter inches. Each argument is separated in chapters that are different colors of paper. At the top left corner of the page is a script like font reading “Argument” followed by a handwritten number to indicate what number argument exists on that page. The text of the argument lives in the center of the page with a new spacing system created for each argument intended to enhance the emotion of that argument.

In reference to argument 20, the participates are Nicholas and Emma. The two characters’ names begin spread apart, eventually coming together for four lines and gradually drifting apart. As the two names drift apart at an equal pace and distance, Nicholas’ name begins to jumble from “Nicholas” to “Ncsalhio” and eventually reading “f u g t.” With only the treatment of their names in space, a story unfolds of two people who started apart, quickly came together and slowly drifted apart as separate entities: one more triumphant than the other.

[^1]: I argue that printed words are printed on the ideal space; there is both a place for books that contain information and stories as well as books that are bookworks.
